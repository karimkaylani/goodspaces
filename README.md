## Inspiration

Our grandparents had to make multiple trips to the store and kept leaving almost empty-handed.

## What it does
A live-updating platform that shares the status of grocery store items and allows users to check to see what is in stock at different stores to optimize their trips.

## How I built it
I built it using Python, the Flask framework, google places and maps API, and the uszipcode python package.

## Challenges I ran into
While building the app as the sole developer, I found it difficult to implement all the features I wanted to, especially considering the time constraint. For example, I was unable to complete the submission framework for people to report the current status of grocery stores.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I am proud of the use of the google places API in order to locate surrounding grocery stores in an organized way using just a zip code. I am also satisfied with how the interactive map is seamlessly integrated with the results list.

## What I learned
I learned how to use the Flask web framework effectively, incorporate google maps and places API, and to integrate designs from the UI/UX designer in Figma.

## What's next for goodspaces
A mobile web-app to allow for more accessibility to the product for those on the go. A notification system to encourage use whenever a user is in a grocery store or when one of their requests gets fulfilled. Integrated social sharing to increase traffic and incentive to use the product.
